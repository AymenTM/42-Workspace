### Assignement:
###### Write a script that takes a text file as a parameter with one login per line and returns the location of each person.
###### The script must use 42’s API to find where students are located in the zones.
######   - If the API is not responding the script should retry until the API respond.
######   - Externalize the API key so you don’t have it in plain text in your script file.
